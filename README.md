### Original Author Shaun Pieling a.k.a.: The Net Ninja

A simple Instragram-like project built with React.js and Google Firebase.
This is a code-along with small improvements such accessibility. It makes the
best use of HTML5 semantic elements and structure to achieve a fully accessible
experience while remaining SEO friendly.

The progress bar has been updated to use the `progress` element and transition
using the built-in attributes instead of manipulating the DOM directly (which
can affect performance in larger projects).
